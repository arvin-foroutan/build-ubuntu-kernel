Subject: [PATCH 17/34] mm: add speculative_page_walk_begin() and
 speculative_page_walk_end()

Speculative page faults will use these to protect against races with
page table reclamation.

This could always be handled by disabling local IRQs as the fast GUP
code does; however speculative page faults do not need to protect
against races with THP page splitting, so a weaker rcu read lock is
sufficient in the MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE case.
