Subject: [PATCH 18/34] mm: refactor __handle_mm_fault() / handle_pte_fault()

Move the code that initializes vmf->pte and vmf->orig_pte from
handle_pte_fault() to its single call site in __handle_mm_fault().

This ensures vmf->pte is now initialized together with the higher levels
of the page table hierarchy. This also prepares for speculative page fault
handling, where the entire page table walk (higher levels down to ptes)
needs special care in the speculative case.
