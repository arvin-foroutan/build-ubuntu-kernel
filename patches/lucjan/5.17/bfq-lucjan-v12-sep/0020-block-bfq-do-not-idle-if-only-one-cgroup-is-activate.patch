Subject: [PATCH 20/69] block, bfq: do not idle if only one cgroup is activated

Now that root group is counted into 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs',
'num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 0' is always true in
bfq_asymmetric_scenario().

Thus change the condition to 'num_groups_with_pending_reqs > 1', so
it's consistent without counting root group.

On the other hand, with the following patches to only count groups(not
ancestors) with pending requests, sync io can be handled concurrently
if only one group has pending requests.
