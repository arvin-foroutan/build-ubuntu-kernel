Subject: [PATCH 58/69] block, bfq: do not idle if only one cgroup is activated

If only one group is activated, there is no need to guarantee the
same share of the throughput of queues in the same group.

Test procedure:
run "fio -numjobs=1 -ioengine=psync -bs=4k -direct=1 -rw=randread..."
multiple times in the same cgroup.

Test result: total bandwidth(Mib/s)
| total jobs | before this patch | after this patch      |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | 33.8              | 33.8                  |
| 2          | 33.8              | 65.4 (32.7 each job)  |
| 4          | 33.8              | 106.8 (26.7 each job) |
| 8          | 33.8              | 126.4 (15.8 each job) |

By the way, if I test with "fio -numjobs=1/2/4/8 ...", test result is
the same with or without this patch. This is because bfq_queue can
be merged in this situation.
