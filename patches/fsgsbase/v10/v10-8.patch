On FSGSBASE systems, the way to handle GS base in the paranoid path is
different from the existing SWAPGS-based entry/exit path handling. Document
the reason and what has to be done for FSGSBASE enabled systems.

+On FSGSBASE systems, however, user space can set GS without kernel
+interaction. It means the value of GS base itself does not imply anything,
+whether a kernel value or a user space value. So, there is no longer a safe
+way to check whether the exception is entering from user mode or kernel
+mode in the paranoid entry code path. So the GS base value needs to be read
+out, saved and the kernel GS base value written. On exit, the saved GS base
+value needs to be restored unconditionally. The non-paranoid entry/exit
+code still uses SWAPGS unconditionally as the state is known.
